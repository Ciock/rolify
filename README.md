Rolify is an app that allows you to play multiple sounds simultaneously, with the ability to manage audio individually. You can also add the music you have on your phone, all completely offline and free.

## Some background

Rolify was created for my Dungeons & Dragons sessions. My DM friend needed to create perfect settings for his adventures, and asked me an app that would allow him to combine the music of a bard with the sounds of a tavern, or the sound of leaves moving in the wind with the sound of a bonfire.

If you also had this need, you know that there is not much on the Play Store...

Most apps allow only one sound at a time, or they are not looped, or you have to pay for them.

I think this app will make many DM's dreams come true!

## Make it yours

In this years I got a lot of requests for new features, and I can't handle all those alone. For this reason I abandoned the project long time ago. Netherless the interest for the app never died, and for this reasone I can't leave this project die.
I tried my best to improve the code to make it easier for everyone to contribute, but I was facing a personal project that I didn't expect to gather such interest. This means rushed code and zero documentation. To public rolify open source I upgraded flutter to the latest version, moved to null safety, pumped up all packages and worked on some old requested features, but the code is far from perfection. I'll happily help everyone who would like to partecipate, touring the code or pointing at where to look at.
